# VirtualQuizGame-OpenCV
## Description of the Project.
The Virtual Quiz is an MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) game where the user can have an new `virtual interaction` experience with the System just by using his hand `gestures`.

## Overview:
The Virtual Quiz Game using `OpenCV` aims to create an interactive and engaging quiz platform that uses computer vision technology. The system will present users with a series of quiz questions on a screen, and participants will respond by simple placing their fingers (index finger and middle finger) that is by crossing them to form a gestures in front the given card answers. OpenCV will detect and analyze the gestures using image processing techniques, accurately capturing user responses. The game will feature real-time scoring and provide immediate feedback to participants. This project intends to offer a fun and innovative way to conduct quizzes, fostering a dynamic learning environment and promtes active participation in educational and recreational settings.
